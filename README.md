1. Identify your user(s)
People who play the board game Dungeons & Dragons
2. What is the problem you’re solving?
Most character sheets for Dungeons & Dragons do not have enough space to list spells AND their descriptions for full spellcasters like wizards and clerics. 
3. What is the solution?
An app that allows you to save characters with a spell list that provides a description for spells
4. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
Create, search and delete characters
Search for spells from D&D API
Add and remove spells for characters
Display spell list with description for chosen character

5. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
Integrating the D&D API to find specific spells
Adding spells with descriptions from the D&D API to specific characters
Storing everything in a database

6. What are the stretch goals?
Adding a refined search function for spells (search for a piece of a string in the name or displaying certain spells by class, level or school of magic) 
Adding other things to the character that one may find useful (character details, dice roller, notes sections etc…) 
Adding a function that allows you to create your own spells and add them to the database or your character (since the API I found only has spells from the player’s handbook and not from expanded content.) 
Being able to sort/search through your own spell list as well as pick and choose what details of your spells that are displayed
Ability for users to sign in and store characters instead of storing characters globally
Moving the database to the cloud instead of storing it in local mongo db
Hosting the app online
